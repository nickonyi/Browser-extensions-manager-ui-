## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Working on this challenge helped me improve my understanding of managing state in React when handling toggle features and filters. I also deepened my knowledge of building responsive layouts using CSS Grid and media queries.

Here's a sample of the toggle function I used in React:

```js
const toggleExtension = (id) => {
  setExtensions((prev) =>
    prev.map((ext) => (ext.id === id ? { ...ext, active: !ext.active } : ext))
  );
};
```
